Fully booked for the next 6 months. (_Updated 2013 December_)

{% include hire_list.html %}

## Why should I hire you?

Because you know the only way to create an awesome product is assemble a great team to build it.

## Services

* **Code Review**: A fresh pair of eyes can help you find new areas for improvement.
* **Full Projects**: You have an amazing business idea that can change the world but you don't know how to code. I am your man.
* **Rescue projects**: You hired a cheap developer and he created a big and ugly tentacular monster. I can help you reboot your project and achieve success. But you will need to get the 'cheap' out of the equation: _Quality work is never cheap_.

## Rate

I provide my expertise for 50â‚¬ / hour.
