I am a freelance Ruby on Rails developer. That means we can work together to craft your ideas into real valuable solutions that clients love.

## Current Status

Fully booked for the next 6 months. (_Updated 2013 August_)

## Why should I hire you?

Because I am pretty good at what I do and honest about what I don't.

## Services

* **Code Review**: A fresh pair of eyes can help you find new areas for improvement.
* **Full Projects**: You have an amazing business idea that can change the world but you don't know how to code. I am your man.
* **Rescue projects**: You hired a cheap developer and he created a big and ugly tentacular monster. I can help you reboot your project and achieve success. But you will need to get the 'cheap' out of the equation: _Quality work is never cheap_.

## What I don't do

**I am not a designer**. A designer takes care of choosing the typography, the colours, the layout, the interaction between all the elements on the page. He owns the user experience. Of course I can modify existing CSS and HTML code to be like I need it to be, but a designer has that ability to take that to the next level.

Never underestimate what a good designer can do for the look'n feel of you app – I love working with one (in fact, I insist).

## Rate

I provide my expertise for 50€ / hour.
