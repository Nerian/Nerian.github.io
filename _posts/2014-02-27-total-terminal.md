As a developer you probably access your terminal hundreds of times a day. If you read the [first article]({% post_url 2014-02-23-how-to-multitask-like-a-pro %}) on how to be a productive developer you already have each application on a space; and one space per application. So in order to get to your Terminal you need to switch spaces. One space.

But there is a better way. What if you could have your Terminal in the space that you are right now, but only visible when you need it? Eliminating context switching is the key to regain your focus and your ability to solve problems real quick. You can have that with one single tool: Total Terminal.

It starts when you computer starts but it remains invisible until you need it. When you need it, you need only to press a shortcut key and a terminal appears at the top of your screen. One keystroke and it's gone.
